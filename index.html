    <h1>EXECUTIVE SKILLS</h1>
    <p> 

    Executive functions (EFs) largely determine your academic success, perhaps even more than intelligence. 
    This is because EFs assist in exhibiting goal-directed behavior. You can be intelligent, 
    but if you are distracted by every stimulus or every internal stimulus, 
    then learning becomes more difficult.
