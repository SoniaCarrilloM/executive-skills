               </h5>

                <p>Self-control means being the boss of our own actions. It‚Äôs like having a remote control for our behavior. When we use self-control, we can:


 <ul>
                        <li>Pause and Think: Before reacting, take a deep breath. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best choice here?‚Äù</li>
                        <li>Make Thoughtful Choices: Instead of acting impulsively, consider the consequences. What happens if we eat all the cookies now? </li>
                        <li>Stay Calm: Even when things feel intense, we can keep our cool. Imagine a calm superhero shield around you!</li>
                    </ul>                  


<p>Your Mission is to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Identify Challenges: Think about situations where self-control is tough. Maybe it‚Äôs resisting that extra screen time or not interrupting during class.</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>


Practice, Practice, Practice: We‚Äôll play games, role-play scenarios, and use positive affirmations. Remember, practice makes us stronger!

                <h5><strong>1. Watch the Video</strong></h5>

                <p>You are going to watch a video about self-control (2:51'). Before watching the video, think about the moments in the past week in which you found it difficult to control yourself. Think about situations where self-control is tough. Maybe it‚Äôs resisting that extra screen time or not interrupting during class.
                  
                  <br/>What happened? What did you think? How did you thoughts make you feel? And last, but surely not least, how did those feelings make you behave? Reflect on these questions. 
                <br/> Draw a table on a piece of paper like the one below and fill it in.  
                    <div class="procast">
